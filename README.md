# a11y.build

This is the source for [a11y.build](https://a11y.build), a site dedicated to teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with accessibility as a fundamental part of the process.

This project is in the process of being built. At some point soon it will be ready to show the world.

## So what's a11y.build?
For now, the plan is to create the site as a series of lessons that teach the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as though all of the most important accessibility features were necessary to make a site work properly because, when you think about it for a second, _they are necessary to make a site work properly_.

The site will be composed of two top-level pages: the blog, and the guide. The idea is to post new content to the blog as I learn it, then refine it and make it a part of the guide.

Eventually the guide will begin to solidify enough that it can be treated as a book or a course on fundamental, a11y-centered development.

Following all of that I imagine I'll want to create a third section with accessible components and how to implement them.

## Why?

The CDC estimates that [26% of adults in the US have some type of disability](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html). While there's a moral imperative to provide access to the content we create, there's also a professional imperative — we should strive to create sites that work as close to 100 percent of the time as possible. If we're creating sites that don't work well for 26% of people, we're creating sites that only work 74% of the time.

And nobody likes skating by with a C average, right?

## Outline
a11y.build will be composed of two approaches to the content. The first, a guide to creating HTML documents from the ground up, presented as a single document with sections devoted to each topic. The second, a collection of posts and tutorials that walk through the practical implementation of a given topic in a friendly way. 

I may follow the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation framework and present the tutorials first. I'm really not sure yet.
