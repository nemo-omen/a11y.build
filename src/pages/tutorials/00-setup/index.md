Web design and development is primarily by editing different kinds of files, usually, (but not always,) `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files. We can't edit files like that with just any editor â€” you can't create a working `.html` file using a program like Microsoft Word. You're going to need an editor that's made specifically for editing plain text files.

But before we get to installing a good editor, let's address something else. Because we'll be working with files, we're going to need an organized place to keep them. On my computer, I keep a folder named `projects`, where I keep individual folders for each of the projects I'm working on. So go ahead and create your own projects folder. You can name it whatever you want, but `projects` is what we'll be referring to throughout any tutorials on this site when referring to the directory where projects are kept.

Okay, now that you have a `projects` folder we can move on to installing a good text editor.

## Installing VS Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an editor used by many, many web developers. It's not the only editor you can use and many developers prefer different editors. That's fine, and you may develop a different preference at some point, but VS Code is pretty hard to beat when it comes to editing the types of files you'll be editing as a web developer.

Go ahead and download, then install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Done? Great, we'll see you in the [next tutorial](/tutorials/01-hello-world)!
